\section{Overview}

This vignette provides an introduction to the analysis of ChIP-seq data with
the `\texttt{mosaics}' package. R package \texttt{mosaics} implements MOSAiCS,
a statistical framework for the analysis of ChIP-seq data, proposed 
in \cite{mosaics}. MOSAiCS stands for ``\textbf{MO}del-based one and
two \textbf{S}ample \textbf{A}nalysis and \textbf{I}nference for
\textbf{C}hIP-\textbf{S}eq Data''. It implements a flexible parametric mixture
modeling approach for detecting peaks, i.e., enriched regions, in one-sample
(ChIP sample) or two-sample (ChIP and control samples) ChIP-seq data.
It can account for mappability and GC content biases that arise in ChIP-seq data.

The package can be loaded with the command:

<<preliminaries,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
options(prompt = "R> ")
@

<<mosaics-prelim>>=
library("mosaics")
@

\section{Getting started}

`\texttt{mosaics}' package provides flexible framework for the ChIP-seq analysis.

If you have the data for matched control sample, 
two-sample analysis is recommended.
If the ChIP-seq data is deeply sequenced, 
the two-sample analysis without mappability and GC content
(Section \ref{two_sample_no_MGC}) is usually appropriate.
For the ChIP-seq data with low sequencing depth,
the two-sample analysis with mappability and GC content 
(Section \ref{two_sample_MGC}) can be useful.
When control sample is not available, `\texttt{mosaics}' package accommodates
one-sample analysis of ChIP-seq data. 
In this case, you should have files for mappability and GC content, 
in addition to the files for ChIP and matched control samples.

We recommend users start from Section \ref{mosaicsRunAll} and
it discusses the most convenient way to do the two-sample analysis
(without using mappability and GC content).
Section \ref{two_sample_no_MGC} discusses each step of the two-sample workflow in detail 
and provides command lines for each step.
Sections \ref{two_sample_MGC} and \ref{one_sample} briefly explain
the workflow and command lines for the two-sample analysis and the one-sample analysis
with mappability and GC content, respectively.

We encourage  questions or requests regarding 
`\texttt{mosaics}' package to be posted on our Google group
\url{http://groups.google.com/group/mosaics_user_group}.

\section{Two-Sample Analysis using \texttt{'mosaicsRunAll'}}\label{mosaicsRunAll}

Two-sample analysis without mappability and GC content can be done 
in a more convenient way, with the command: 

<<mosaicsRunAll,eval=FALSE>>=
     mosaicsRunAll( 
         chipFile="/scratch/eland/STAT1_ChIP_eland_results.txt", 
         chipFileFormat="eland_result", 
         controlFile="/scratch/eland/STAT1_control_eland_results.txt", 
         controlFileFormat="eland_result", 
         binfileDir="/scratch/bin/", 
         peakFile=c("/scratch/peak/STAT1_peak_list.bed", 
                    "/scratch/peak/STAT1_peak_list.gff"),
         peakFileFormat=c("bed", "gff"),
         reportSummary=TRUE, 
         summaryFile="/scratch/reports/mosaics_summary.txt", 
         reportExploratory=TRUE, 
         exploratoryFile="/scratch/reports/mosaics_exploratory.pdf", 
         reportGOF=TRUE, 
         gofFile="/scratch/reports/mosaics_GOF.pdf",
         byChr=FALSE, useChrfile=FALSE, chrfile=NULL, excludeChr="chrM",
         PET=FALSE, FDR=0.05, fragLen=200, binSize=fragLen, capping=0,
         bgEst="automatic", signalModel="BIC", parallel=TRUE, nCore=8 )
@

`\texttt{mosaicsRunAll}' method imports aligned read files, converts them to bin-level files (generated bin-level files will be saved in the directory 
specified in `\texttt{binfileDir}' argument for future use),
fits the MOSAiCS model, identifies peaks, and exports the peak list. 
In addition, users can also make `\texttt{mosaicsRunAll}' method generate diverse analysis reports, 
such as summary report of parameters and analysis results, exploratory plots, and goodness of fit (GOF) plots.

\section{Workflow: Two-Sample Analysis}\label{two_sample_no_MGC}

\subsection{Constructing Bin-Level Files from the Aligned Read File}\label{constructBins}

R package `\texttt{mosaics}' analyzes the data after converting aligned read files 
into bin-level files for modeling and visualization purposes.
These bin-level data can easily be generated from the aligned read files with the command: 

<<constructBins,eval=FALSE>>=
constructBins( infile="/scratch/eland/STAT1_eland_results.txt", 
    fileFormat="eland_result", outfileLoc="/scratch/eland/", 
    byChr=FALSE, useChrfile=FALSE, chrfile=NULL, excludeChr="chrM", 
    PET=FALSE, fragLen=200, binSize=200, capping=0 )
@

You can specify the name and file format of the aligned read file 
in `\texttt{infile}' and `\texttt{fileFormat}' arguments, respectively.
The `\texttt{PET}' argument indicates whether the file is paired-end tag (`\texttt{PET=TRUE}') or single-end tag (`\texttt{PET=FALSE}') ChIP-Seq data.
Allowed aligned read file formats depend on the `\texttt{PET}' argument.
`\texttt{constructBins}' method currently allows the following aligned read file formats for SET ChIP-Seq data:
Eland result (`\texttt{"eland}$\_$\texttt{result"}'), Eland extended (`\texttt{"eland}$\_$\texttt{extended"}'),
Eland export (`\texttt{"eland}$\_$\texttt{export"}'), default Bowtie (`\texttt{"bowtie"}'), SAM (`\texttt{"sam"}'), BED (`\texttt{"bed"}'), and CSEM BED (`\texttt{"csem"}').
%This method assumes that these aligned read files are obtained from single-end tag (SET) experiments.
For PET ChIP-Seq data, `\texttt{constructBins}' method currently accepts the
Eland result (`\texttt{"eland}$\_$\texttt{result"}') and SAM (`\texttt{"sam"}') file formats.
If input file format is neither BED nor CSEM BED,
it retains only reads mapping uniquely to the reference genome (uni-reads). 
See Appendices \ref{example_aligned_SET} and \ref{example_aligned_PET} for example lines of each aligned read file format.

Even though `\texttt{constructBins}' retains only uni-reads for most aligned read file formats,
reads mapping to multiple locations on the reference genome (multi-reads)
can be easily incorporated into bin-level files by utilizing our multi-read allocator, 
\texttt{CSEM} (ChIP-Seq multi-read allocator using Expectation-Maximization algorithm).
Galaxy tool for CSEM is available in Galaxy Tool Shed (\url{http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/}; ``csem'' under ``Next Gen Mappers''). Stand-alone version of CSEM is also available at \url{http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~keles/Software/multi-reads/}.
CSEM exports uni-reads and allocated multi-reads into standard BED file
and the corresponding bin-level files can be constructed 
by applying `\texttt{constructBins}' method to this BED file with the argument
`\texttt{fileFormat="csem"}'.

`\texttt{constructBins}' can generate a single bin-level file containing all chromosomes
(for a genome-wide analysis) or multiple bin-level files for each chromosome
(for a chromosome-wise analysis).
If `\texttt{byChr=FALSE}', bin-level data for all chromosomes are exported to one file
named as `\texttt{[infileName]}$\_$\texttt{fragL[fragLen]}$\_$\texttt{bin[binSize].txt}' (for SET data)
or `\texttt{[infileName]}$\_$\texttt{bin[binSize].txt}' (for PET data),
where \texttt{[infileName]}, \texttt{[fragLen]}, and \texttt{[binSize]} are
name of aligned read file, average fragment length, and bin size, respectively.
If `\texttt{byChr=TRUE}', bin-level data for each chromosome is exported
to a separate file named as `\texttt{[infileName]}$\_$\texttt{fragL[fragLen]}$\_$\texttt{bin[binSize]}$\_$\texttt{[chrID].txt}' (for SET data) or `\texttt{[infileName]}$\_$\texttt{bin[binSize]}$\_$\texttt{[chrID].txt}' (for PET data),
where \texttt{[chrID]} is chromosome ID that reads align to.
These chromosome IDs (\texttt{[chrID]}) are extracted from the aligned read file.
The constructed bin-level files are exported to the directory 
specified in `\texttt{outfileLoc}' argument.

The `\texttt{useChrfile}' argument indicates whether to use the file containing chromosome ID and chromosome size, which is specified in the `\texttt{chrfile}' argument.
See Appendix \ref{example_chrfile} for the example lines of this chromosome information file.
If you want to exclude some chromosomes in the processed bin-level files,
you can specify these chromosomes in `\texttt{excludeChr}' argument.
The `\texttt{excludeChr}' argument will be ignored if `\texttt{useChrfile=TRUE}'.

You can specify average fragment length and bin size in `\texttt{fragLen}' and `\texttt{binSize}' arguments, respectively,
and these arguments control the resolution of bin-level ChIP-seq data.
By default, average fragment length is set to 200 bp, which is the common fragment length
for Illumina sequences, and bin size equals to average fragment length.
The `\texttt{fragLen}' argument is ignored for PET ChIP-seq data (`\texttt{PET = TRUE}').
`\texttt{capping}' argument indicates maximum number of reads allowed to start at each nucleotide position.
Using some small value for capping (e.g., `\texttt{capping=3}') will exclude extremely large read counts that might correspond to PCR amplification artifacts, which is especially useful for the ChIP-seq data with low sequencing depth. 
Capping is not applied (default) if `\texttt{capping}' is set to some non-positive value, e.g., `\texttt{capping=0}'.

\subsection{Reading Bin-Level Data into the R Environment}\label{readBins}

You now have bin-level ChIP data and matched control sample data
from '\texttt{constructBins}'.
In this vignette, we use chromosome 21 data from a ChIP-seq
experiment of STAT1 binding in interferon-$\gamma$-stimulated HeLa S3 cells
\cite{stat1}. `\texttt{mosaicsExample}' package provides this example dataset.

<<mosaicsExample-prelim>>=
library(mosaicsExample)
@

Bin-level data can be imported to the R environment with the command:

<<io-readbin>>=
exampleBinData <- readBins( type=c("chip","input"),
    fileName=c( system.file( file.path("extdata","chip_chr21.txt"), package="mosaicsExample"),
    system.file( file.path("extdata","input_chr21.txt"), package="mosaicsExample") ) )
@

For the  `\texttt{type}' argument, 
\texttt{"chip"} and \texttt{"input"} indicate bin-level ChIP data
control sample data, respectively. You need to specify the corresponding file names 
in `\texttt{fileName}'. `\texttt{mosaics}' package assumes that each file name 
in `\texttt{fileName}' is provided in the same order as in `\texttt{type}'. 

In \texttt{mosaics} package, you can do either genome-wide analysis or chromosome-wise analysis
and this analysis type will be determined automatically 
based on the contents of bin-level files imported using `\texttt{readBins}'.
If the bin-level files contain more than one chromosome
(i.e., bin-level files are obtained using `\texttt{byChr=FALSE}' in `\texttt{constructBins}'), 
`\texttt{mosaicsFit}' will analyze all the chromosomes simultaneously (genome-wide analysis).
Note that if these bin-level files contain different sets of chromosomes,
then `\texttt{readBins}' method will utilize only the intersection of them.
If bin-level files are obtained using `\texttt{byChr=FALSE}' in `\texttt{constructBins}',
each bin-level file contains data for only one chromosome
and each of these bin-level files need to be analyzed separately (chromosome-wise analysis).
The genome-wide analysis usually provide more stable model fitting and peak identification results
so it is recommended for most cases.

R package \texttt{mosaics} provides functions for generating simple summaries
of the data. The following command prints out basic information about the
bin-level data, such as number of bins and total ``effective tag counts''.
``Total effective tag counts'' is defined as the sum of the ChIP tag counts of all
bins. This value is usually larger than the sequencing depth since tags are
counted after extension to average fragment length and an extended fragment can
contribute to multiple bins. 

<<io-bindata-show>>=
exampleBinData
@

`\texttt{print}' method returns the bin-level data in data frame format.

<<io-bindata-print>>=
print(exampleBinData)[51680:51690,]
@

`\texttt{plot}' method provides exploratory plots for the ChIP data. Different
type of plots can be obtained by varying the `\texttt{plotType}' argument.
`\texttt{plotType="input"}' generates a plot of mean ChIP tag counts versus
control tag counts. If `\texttt{plotType}' is not specified, this method plots the
histogram of ChIP tag counts.

<<io-bindata-plot,eval=FALSE>>=
plot( exampleBinData )
plot( exampleBinData, plotType="input" )
@

Figures \ref{fig:bindata-plot-hist} and \ref{fig:bindata-plot-input} display
examples of different types of plots. The relationship
between mean ChIP tag counts and control tag counts seems to be linear,
especially for small  control tag counts (Figure \ref{fig:bindata-plot-input}).

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
<<fig-bindata-plot-hist,fig=TRUE,height=5,width=5,echo=FALSE>>=
plot(exampleBinData)
@
\caption{\label{fig:bindata-plot-hist} Histograms of the  count data 
from ChIP and control samples.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
<<fig-bindata-plot-input,fig=TRUE,height=5,width=5,echo=FALSE>>=
plot( exampleBinData, plotType="input" )
@
\caption{\label{fig:bindata-plot-input} Mean ChIP tag count versus
Control tag count.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fitting the MOSAiCS Model}\label{mosaicsFit}

We are now ready to fit a MOSAiCS model using the bin-level data above
(\texttt{exampleBinData})   with the command:

<<io-mosaicsfit>>=
exampleFit <- mosaicsFit( exampleBinData, analysisType="IO", bgEst="automatic" )
@

`\texttt{analysisType="IO"}' indicates implementation of the two-sample analysis.
`\texttt{bgEst}' argument determines background estimation approach.
`\texttt{bgEst="matchLow"}' estimates background distribution using only bins with low tag counts
and it is appropriate for the data with relatively low sequencing depth. 
`\texttt{bgEst="rMOM"}' estimates background distribution using robust method of moment (MOM) and
it is appropriate for the data with relatively high sequencing depth.
If `\texttt{bgEst="automatic"}' (default), `\texttt{mosaicsFit}' tries its best guess 
for the background estimation approach, based on the data provided.
If the goodness of fit obtained using `\texttt{bgEst="automatic"}' is not satisfactory,
we recommend to try `\texttt{bgEst="matchLow"}' and `\texttt{bgEst="rMOM"}' 
and it might improve the model fit.

`\texttt{mosaicsFit}' fits both one-signal-component and two-signal-component
models. When identifying peaks, you can choose the number of signal components
to be used for the final model. The optimal choice of the number of signal
components depends on the characteristics of data. In order to support users
in the choice of optimal signal model, \texttt{mosaics} package provides
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values and Goodness of Fit (GOF) plots
of these signal models. 

The following command prints out BIC values of one-signal-component and
two-signal-component models, with additional information about the parameters
used in fitting the background (non-enriched) distribution. A lower BIC value
indicates a better model fit. For this dataset, we conclude that the
two-signal-component model has a lower BIC and hence it provides a better fit.

<<io-mosaicsfit-show>>=
exampleFit
@

`\texttt{plot}' method provides the GOF plot.  This plots allows visual
comparisons of the fits of the background, one-signal-component, and
two-signal-component models with the actual data.  Figure
\ref{fig:mosaicsfit-plot} displays the GOF plot for our dataset and we 
conclude that the two-signal-component model provides a better fit as is also
supported by its lower BIC value compared to the one-signal component model. 

<<io-mosaicsfit-plot,eval=FALSE>>=
plot(exampleFit)
@

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
<<fig-mosaicsfit-plot,fig=TRUE,height=5,width=5,echo=FALSE>>=
plot(exampleFit)
@
\caption{\label{fig:mosaicsfit-plot} Goodness of Fit (GOF) plot. Depicted are
actual data for ChIP and control samples with simulated data from the following
fitted models: (Sim:N): Background model; (Sim:N+S1): one-signal-component
model; (Sim:N+S1+S2): two-signal-component model. }
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Identifying Peaks Based on the Fitted Model}\label{mosaicsPeak}

Using BIC values and GOF plots in the previous section, we concluded that
two-signal-component model fits our data better. Next, we will identify peaks
with the two-signal-component model at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05
using the command:

<<ts-mosaicspeak>>=
examplePeak <- mosaicsPeak( exampleFit, signalModel="2S", FDR=0.05, 
maxgap=200, minsize=50, thres=10 )
@

`\texttt{signalModel="2S"}' indicates two-signal-component model. Similarly,
one-signal-component model can be specified by `\texttt{signalModel="1S"}'. 
FDR can be controlled at the desired level by specifying `\texttt{FDR}' argument. 
In addition to these two essential parameters, you can also control three more
parameters, `\texttt{maxgap}', `\texttt{minsize}', and `\texttt{thres}'. These
parameters are for refining initial peaks called using specified signal model
and FDR.  Initial nearby peaks are merged if the distance (in bp) between them
is less than `\texttt{maxgap}'. Some initial peaks are removed if their lengths
are shorter than `\texttt{minsize}' or their ChIP tag counts are less 
than `\texttt{thres}'.

If you use a bin size shorter than the average fragment length in the
experiment, we recommend to set `\texttt{maxgap}'  to the  average fragment
length and `\texttt{minsize}'  to the bin size. This setting removes peaks 
that are too narrow (e.g., singletons). If you set the bin size to the average
fragment length (or maybe bin size is larger than the average fragment length),
we recommend  setting `\texttt{minsize}'  to a value  smaller than the average
fragment length while leaving `\texttt{maxgap}' the same as the average
fragment length. This is to prevent filtering using `\texttt{minsize}' because
initial peaks would already be at a reasonable width. `\texttt{thres}' is
employed to filter out initial peaks with very small ChIP tag counts because
such peaks might be false discoveries. Optimal choice of `\texttt{thres}'
depends on the sequencing depth of the ChIP-seq data to be analyzed. If you
don't wish to filter out initial peaks using ChIP tag counts, you can set
`\texttt{thres}'  to an arbitrary negative value.

The following command prints out a summary of identified peaks including 
the number of  peaks identified, median peak width, and the empirical false
discovery rate (FDR).

<<io-mosaicspeak-show>>=
examplePeak
@

`\texttt{print}' method returns the peak calling results in data frame format.
This data frame can be used as an input for downstream analysis such as motif
finding. This output might have different number of columns, depending on
`\texttt{analysisType}' of `\texttt{mosaicsFit}'. For example, if
`\texttt{analysisType="TS"}', columns are peak start position, peak end
position, peak width, averaged posterior probability, minimum posterior
probability, averaged ChIP tag count, maximum ChIP tag count, averaged control
tag count, averaged control tag count scaled by sequencing depth, averaged log
base 2 ratio of ChIP over input tag counts, averaged mappability score, and
averaged GC content score for each peak. Here, the posterior probability of a
bin refers to  the probability that the bin is not a peak conditional on data.
Hence, smaller posterior probabilities provide more evidence that the bin is
actually a peak.

<<io-mosaicspeak-print>>=
print(examplePeak)[1:15,]
@

You can export peak calling results to text files in diverse file formats.
Currently, `\texttt{mosaics}' package supports TXT, BED, and GFF file formats.
In the exported file, TXT file format (`\texttt{type="txt"}') includes all the
columns that `\texttt{print}' method returns. `\texttt{type="bed"}' and
`\texttt{type="gff"}' export peak calling results in standard BED and GFF file
formats, respectively, where score is the averaged ChIP tag counts in each
peak. Peak calling results can be exported in TXT, BED, and GFF file formats,
respectively, by the commands:

<<io-mosaicspeak-export>>=
export( examplePeak, type="txt", filename="TSpeakList.txt" )
export( examplePeak, type="bed", filename="TSpeakList.bed" )
export( examplePeak, type="gff", filename="TSpeakList.gff" )
@

`\texttt{fileLoc}' and `\texttt{fileName}' indicate the directory and the name
of the exported file.

\section{Two-Sample Analysis with Mappability and GC Content}\label{two_sample_MGC}

For the two-sample analysis with mappability and GC content and the one-sample analysis,
you also need bin-level mappability, GC content, and sequence ambiguity 
score files for the reference genome you are working with.
If you are working with organisms such as human (HG18 and HG19), mouse (MM9), 
rat (RN4), and Arabidopsis (TAIR9), you can download their corresponding 
preprocessed mappability, GC content, and sequence ambiguity score files 
at \url{http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~keles/Software/mosaics/}. 
If your reference genome of interest is not listed on our website, 
you can inquire about it at our Google group, 
\url{http://groups.google.com/group/mosaics_user_group}, and we would be happy 
to add your genome of interest to the list. 
The companion website also provides 
all the related scripts and easy-to-follow instructions to prepare these files. 
Please check \url{http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~keles/Software/mosaics/} 
for more details.

You can import bin-level data and fit MOSAiCS model 
for the two-sample analysis using mappability and GC content with the commands:

<<ts-readbin>>=
exampleBinData <- readBins( type=c("chip","input","M","GC","N"),

For the  `\texttt{type}' argument, \texttt{"chip"}, \texttt{"input"},
\texttt{"M"}, \texttt{"GC"}, and \texttt{"N"} indicate bin-level ChIP data, 
control sample data, mappability score, GC content score, and sequence
ambiguity score, respectively.

When you have mappability and GC contents, 
`\texttt{plot}' method provides additional plot types.
`\texttt{plotType="M"}' and `\texttt{plotType="GC"}' generate plots of mean
ChIP tag counts versus mappability and GC content scores, respectively.
Moreover, `\texttt{plotType="M|input"}' and
`\texttt{plotType="GC|input"}' generate plots of mean ChIP tag counts versus
mappability and GC content scores, respectively, conditional on control tag
counts.

<<ts-bindata-plot>>=
plot( exampleBinData, plotType="M" )
plot( exampleBinData, plotType="GC" )
plot( exampleBinData, plotType="M|input" )
plot( exampleBinData, plotType="GC|input" )  
@

As discussed in \cite{mosaics}, 
we observe that mean ChIP tag count increases as mappability score increases
(Figure \ref{fig:bindata-plot-M}). Mean ChIP tag count depends on GC score
in a non-linear fashion (Figure \ref{fig:bindata-plot-GC}). 
When we condition on control tag counts (Figures \ref{fig:bindata-plot-M-input}
and \ref{fig:bindata-plot-GC-input}), mean ChIP tag count versus mappability
and GC content relations exhibit similar patterns to that of marginal plots
given in Figures  \ref{fig:bindata-plot-M} and \ref{fig:bindata-plot-GC}.
MOSAiCS incorporates this observation by modeling ChIP tag counts from non-peak
regions with a small number of control tag counts as a function of
mappability, GC content, and control tag counts.

Application of MOSAiCS to multiple case studies of ChIP-seq data
with low sequencing depth showed that consideration of
mappability and GC content in the model improves sensitivity and specificity 
of peak identification even in the presence of a control sample \cite{mosaics}.
\texttt{mosaics} package accommodates a two-sample analysis with
mappability and GC content by specification of `\texttt{analysisType="TS"}'
when calling the `\texttt{mosaicsFit}' method.

<<ts-mosaicsfit,eval=FALSE>>=
exampleFit <- mosaicsFit( exampleBinData, analysisType="TS", bgEst="automatic" )
@

Peak identification can be done exactly in the same way
as in the case of the two-sample analysis without mappability and GC content.

<<os-mosaicspeak,eval=FALSE>>=
OneSamplePeak <- mosaicsPeak( OneSampleFit, signalModel="2S", FDR=0.05,
maxgap=200, minsize=50, thres=10 )
@
         
\section{One-Sample Analysis}\label{one_sample}

When control sample is not available, `\texttt{mosaics}' package accommodates
one-sample analysis of ChIP-seq data. Implementation of the MOSAiCS one-sample
model is very similar to that  of  the two-sample analysis. Bin-level data for
the one-sample analysis can be imported to the R environment with the command:

<<os-readbin,eval=FALSE>>=
exampleBinData <- readBins( type=c("chip","M","GC","N"),
    fileName=c( system.file( file.path("extdata","chip_chr21.txt"), package="mosaicsExample"),
    system.file( file.path("extdata","M_chr21.txt"), package="mosaicsExample"),
    system.file( file.path("extdata","GC_chr21.txt"), package="mosaicsExample"),
    system.file( file.path("extdata","N_chr21.txt"), package="mosaicsExample") ) )
@

%Note that you don't need to provide `\texttt{"input"}' in `\texttt{type}' and
%the file name of  a control dataset in `\texttt{fileName}' here. 
In order to fit a MOSAiCS model for the one-sample analysis, you need to specify
`\texttt{analysisType="OS"}' %instead of `\texttt{analysisType="TS"}' 
when calling  the `\texttt{mosaicsFit}' method.

<<os-mosaicsfit,eval=FALSE>>=
exampleFit <- mosaicsFit( exampleBinData, analysisType="OS", bgEst="automatic" )
@

Peak identification can be done exactly in the same way as in the case 
of the two-sample analysis.

<<os-mosaicspeak,eval=FALSE>>=
exampleFit <- mosaicsPeak( exampleFit, signalModel="2S", FDR=0.05,
maxgap=200, minsize=50, thres=10 )

\section{Generating Wiggle Files to View on Genome Browsers}\label{generateWig}

R package `\texttt{mosaics}' can generate wiggle files (\url{http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html}) for visualization purposes.
These wiggle files can be used as input for many genome browsers such as the UCSC genome browser (\url{http://genome.ucsc.edu/}). 
These wiggle files can easily be generated from the aligned read files with the command: 

<<generateWig,eval=FALSE>>=
generateWig( infile="/scratch/eland/STAT1_eland_results.txt", 
    fileFormat="eland_result", outfileLoc="/scratch/eland/", 
    byChr=FALSE, useChrfile=FALSE, chrfile=NULL, excludeChr="chrM", 
    PET=FALSE, fragLen=200, span=200, capping=0, normConst=1 )
@

The `\texttt{generateWig}' function has similar arguments as the `\texttt{constructBins}' function,
except that it has `\texttt{span}' and `\texttt{normConst}' arguments 
instead of the `\texttt{binSize}' argument of the `\texttt{constructBins}' function.
The `\texttt{generateWig}' function supports the same set of aligned read file formats as in the `\texttt{constructBins}' function.
The `\texttt{span}' argument indicates span used in wiggle files.
The `\texttt{normConst}' argument means the normalizing constant to scale the values in wiggle files
and it is especially useful when wiggle files for multiple related samples are generated and compared.
In the resulting wiggle files, values are scaled by the value specified in the `\texttt{normConst}' argument.

`\texttt{generateWig}' can generate a single wiggle file containing all chromosomes or multiple wiggle files for each chromosome.
If `\texttt{byChr=FALSE}', all chromosomes are exported to one file
named as `\texttt{[infileName]}$\_$\texttt{fragL[fragLen]}$\_$\texttt{span[span].wig}' (for SET data)
or `\texttt{[infileName]}$\_$\texttt{span[span].wig}' (for PET data),
where \texttt{[infileName]}, \texttt{[fragLen]}, and \texttt{[span]} are
name of aligned read file, average fragment length, and span, respectively.
If `\texttt{byChr=TRUE}', each chromosome is exported to a separate file named as `\texttt{[infileName]}$\_$\texttt{fragL[fragLen]}$\_$\texttt{span[span]}$\_$\texttt{[chrID].wig}' (for SET data) or
`\texttt{[infileName]}$\_$\texttt{span[span]}$\_$\texttt{[chrID].wig}' (for PET data),
where \texttt{[chrID]} is chromosome ID that reads align to.
%These chromosome IDs (\texttt{[chrID]}) are extracted from the aligned read file.
The constructed wiggle files are exported to the directory 
specified in `\texttt{outfileLoc}' argument.

\section{Case Studies: Tuning Parameters to Improve the MOSAiCS Fit}\label{case_studies}

Because the \texttt{mosaics} package is based on the statistical modeling approach,
it is important to check that we have nice model fits.
Goodness of fit (GOF) plots generated from the `\texttt{plot}' method
are key tools that users can utilize to check the MOSAiCS fit and improve it if necessary.
In this section, we will discuss several case studies based on real ChIP-Seq data,
especially focusing on understanding unsatisfactory MOSAiCS fits and suggesting strategies to improve it.
The case studies illustrated in this section are based on \cite{bookchapter}
and we provided deeper discussion and example analysis codes in this book chapter.

\subsection{Case 1}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\subfigure[When the background estimation approach was automatically chosen]{
   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth] {GOF_matchLow.pdf}

\subfigure[When the background estimation approach was explicitly specified]{

\caption{ Case \#1. Goodness of fit when the background estimation approach was automatically chosen by \texttt{mosaics} package (a) and explicitly specified as robust method of moment (b). The MOSAiCS fit was significantly improved by explicitly specifying the background estimation approach. \label{fig:case_studies_GOF_no1} }
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:case_studies_GOF_no1}a shows the GOF plot for the two-sample analysis without using mappability and GC content. The GOF plot indicates that ChIP tag counts simulated from the fitted model are on average higher than the actual ChIP-Seq data. Moreover, estimated background dominates in the fitted model. In such cases (\textit{over-estimation of background}), we usually have much smaller number of peaks. This problem occurred essentially because `\texttt{mosaicsFit}' guessed using bins with low ChIP tag counts (`\texttt{bgEst="matchLow"}') as the optimal background estimation approach, from its automatic selection (`\texttt{bgEst="automatic"}'). Although automatic selection usually works well, there are some cases that it does not result in optimal background estimation approach. In this case, the MOSAiCS fit can be improved by explicitly specifying the background estimation approach with the command:

<<tuning-case1,eval=FALSE>>=
exampleFit <- mosaicsFit( exampleBinData, analysisType="IO", bgEst="rMOM" )
@

Figure \ref{fig:case_studies_GOF_no1}b shows that the MOSAiCS fit was significantly improved by explicitly using the robust method of moment approach (`\texttt{bgEst="rMOM"}').

\subsection{Case 2}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\subfigure[`\texttt{truncProb = 0.999}' (default)]{
   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth] {Figure5c.pdf}
 }
\subfigure[`\texttt{truncProb = 0.80}']{
   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth] {Figure5d.pdf}
 }
\caption{ Case \#2. Goodness of fit when default `\texttt{truncProb}' value (0.999) is used (a) and `\texttt{truncProb = 0.80}' is explicitly specified (b). The MOSAiCS fit was significantly improved by lowering the `\texttt{truncProb}' value.
\label{fig:case_studies_GOF_no2} }
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:case_studies_GOF_no2}a shows the GOF plot for the two-sample analysis without using mappability and GC content. The GOF plot indicates that the MOSAiCS fit is unsatisfactory for the bins with low ChIP tag counts. This problem occurred essentially because background estimation was affected by some bins with high tag counts in the matched control data. In the two-sample analysis without using mappability and GC content, the `\texttt{truncProb}' argument indicates proportion of bins that are not considered as outliers in the control data and it controls the functional form used for the control data. Although our empirical studies indicates that default `\texttt{truncProb}' value usually works well, there are some cases that it does not result in optimal background estimation. In this case, the MOSAiCS fit can be improved by lowering the `\texttt{truncProb}' value with the command: 

<<tuning-case2,eval=FALSE>>=
exampleFit <- mosaicsFit( exampleBinData, analysisType="IO", 
	bgEst="automatic", truncProb=0.80 )
@

Figure \ref{fig:case_studies_GOF_no2}b shows that the MOSAiCS fit was significantly improved by using `\texttt{truncProb = 0.80}'.

\subsection{Case 3}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\subfigure[Two-sample analysis without mappability and GC content]{
   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth] {Figure5a.pdf}

\caption{ Case \#3. Goodness of fit for the two-sample analysis without utilizing mappability and GC content (a). The MOSAiCS fit was improved when we use the two-sample analysis utilizing mappability and GC content (b).
\label{fig:case_studies_GOF_no3} }
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:case_studies_GOF_no3}a displays the GOF plot for the two-sample analysis without utilizing mappability and GC content. Neither the blue (two-signal component) nor the red (one-signal component) curve provides good fit to the ChIP data. In this case, we consider fitting a two-sample analysis with mappability and GC content. Figure \ref{fig:case_studies_GOF_no3}b displays the GOF plot for the two-sample analysis with mappability and GC content in addition to Input and the goodness of fit improves significantly by utilizing mappability and GC content. 

\subsection{Note on Parameter Tuning}

Overall, unsatisfactory model fits can be improved via the tuning parameters in the `\texttt{mosaicsFit}' function. Our empirical studies suggest that as the sequencing depths are getting larger, genomic features mappability and GC content have less of an impact on the overall model fit. In particular, we suggest tuning the the two-sample model without mappability and GC content in the cases of unsatisfactory fits before switching to a fit with mappability and GC content. The following are some general tuning suggestions: for the two-sample analysis without utilizing mappability and GC content, lowering the value of the `\texttt{truncProb}' parameter; for the two-sample analysis with mappability and GC content, a larger `\texttt{s}' parameter and a smaller `\texttt{meanThres}' parameter; for the one-sample analysis with mappability and GC content, varying the `\texttt{meanThres}' parameter are the general tuning guidelines. Although MOSAiCS has two additional tunable parameters, `\texttt{k}' and `\texttt{d}', we have accumulated ample empirical evidence through analyzing many datasets that the default values of `\texttt{k = 3}' and `\texttt{d = 0.25}' work well for these parameters \cite{bookchapter}. If you encounter a fitting problem you need help with, feel free to contact us at our Google group, \url{http://groups.google.com/group/mosaics_user_group}.

%In the two-sample analysis using mappability and GC content, users can control three tuning parameters: `\texttt{s}', `\texttt{d}', and `\texttt{meanThres}'.  `\texttt{s}' and `\texttt{d}' are parameters of the background distribution and control the functional form used for the control data. Please see \cite{mosaics} for further details on these two model parameters. `\texttt{meanThres}' controls the number of strata used at the robust linear regression modeling step of the background distribution fitting. `\texttt{mosaics}' package uses the following parameter setting as default:

%<<tuning-ts,eval=FALSE>>=
%exampleFit <- mosaicsFit( exampleBinData, analysisType="TS", 
%	bgEst="automatic", meanThres=1, s=2, d=0.25 )
%@

%Users might need to consider parameter tuning especially when the fitted background model is too similar to the actual data, resulting in too few peaks. If such cases are detected or predicted, `\texttt{mosaicsFit}' prints out warning or error messages. You may also be able to detect this case using the GOF plot. Using a higher `\texttt{s}' value and lower `\texttt{meanThres}' often solves the problem, e.g., `\texttt{s = 6}' and `\texttt{meanThres = 0}'.

%In addition to `\texttt{analysisType}', `\texttt{mosaicsFit}' method provides parameters to tune the background distribution of the MOSAiCS model. We specified appropriate default values for these parameters based on computational experiments and analysis of diverse ChIP-seq datasets. Default values work well in general but some tuning might be required for some cases. You may need to consider parameter tuning if the fitted background model is too similar to the actual data in the GOF plot or you encounter some warning or error messages while running `\texttt{mosaicsFit}' method. Section \ref{tuning} provides basic guidelines on parameter tuning. If you encounter a fitting problem you need help with, feel free to contact us at our Google group, \url{http://groups.google.com/group/mosaics_user_group}.
